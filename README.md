# Wine Quality Prediction 🍷

This project uses various machine learning models like Random Forest, Neural Networks (MLPClassifier), etc., to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical features from a CSV dataset.

## 📁 Files
- `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing EDA, model training, and evaluation.
- `WineQT.csv`: Dataset containing wine quality records.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ds231/wine-quality-prediction.git
   cd wine-quality-prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook wine_quality_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Model Performance
The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix.
