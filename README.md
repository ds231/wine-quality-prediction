# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction ‚Äì ML Project by Devanshu Singh

This project is part of my self-driven machine learning journey, combining both theoretical knowledge and practical application using real-world datasets. The objective is to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties using various classification algorithms.

## üß† Objective

Predict wine quality from the `WineQT.csv` dataset using machine learning classifiers such as:
- Random Forest
- MLPClassifier (Neural Network)
- And potentially more (SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.)

## üöÄ How to Run This Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ds231/wine-quality-prediction.git
   cd wine-quality-prediction
2. **Install Requirements**
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Launch the Notebook
   bash
   jupyter notebook wine_quality_prediction.ipynb


   Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Each evaluation metric helps provide a deeper understanding of how the models perform across different aspects of prediction.
